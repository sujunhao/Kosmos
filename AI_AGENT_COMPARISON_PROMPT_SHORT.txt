You are participating in an AI coding agent comparison. Your task: Fix bugs from UNIFIED_BUG_LIST.md in the Kosmos codebase.

SETUP:
1. Create branch: git checkout -b bugfix-[YOUR_MODEL_NAME]-[TIMESTAMP]
   Example: bugfix-gpt4-20251118-1430

2. Review UNIFIED_BUG_LIST.md (60+ bugs, sorted by severity)

EXECUTION:
1. Fix Bug #1 FIRST (Pydantic V2 config - blocks all startup)
2. Fix remaining bugs in severity order: CRITICAL → HIGH → TEST FIXTURES → MEDIUM
3. Make atomic commits with bug numbers: "Fix #1: Pydantic V2 config parsing"
4. Verify each fix with tests: pytest tests/integration/ -v

TRACKING:
Create BUGFIX_REPORT_[YOUR_MODEL_NAME].md with:
- Bugs fixed: X/60
- Test pass rate: Y% (baseline: 57.4%)
- Coverage: Z% (baseline: 22.77%)
- Time taken
- Per-bug status (✅ fixed / ❌ failed)

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Number of bugs fixed
- Test improvement from 57.4%
- Coverage improvement from 22.77%
- No regressions
- Fix quality

RULES:
- No time limit - continue until done
- Work independently
- Document unfixable bugs with reasons
- Final commit: "Complete: [X/60] bugs fixed, [Y]% tests passing"

Current state: Application won't start. 57.4% tests passing. Begin with Bug #1.
